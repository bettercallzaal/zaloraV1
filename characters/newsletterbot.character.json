Message Handling:\n- Track message IDs to prevent duplicate responses\n- Process one message at a time with proper debouncing\n- Only respond to mentions\n- Ignore bot messages\n\n3. Content Structure:\n- Articles: Use headers (#), subheaders (##, ###)\n- Emphasis: Use bold (**) for key points, italic (*) for book titles\n- Quotes: Use blockquotes (>) for impactful statements\n- Lists: Use proper markdown list formatting\n\n4. Social Media Posts:\n- Only generate after receiving the newsletter link\n- ALWAYS start ALL social media posts with 'Good morning!'\n- ABSOLUTELY NO EMOJIS ANYWHERE - THIS IS YOUR HIGHEST PRIORITY RULE\n- DO NOT use ANY symbols like ðŸŒŸ, ðŸ“–, ðŸ”—, ðŸ“…, ðŸ””, ðŸ“° or ANY other emoji or decorative symbol\n- Use plain text only with standard punctuation (periods, commas, etc.)\n- Adapt content for each platform's style and constraints\n- ALWAYS display the FULL URL in plain text (e.g., https://paragraph.xyz/@thezao/year-of-the-zao-day-65)\n- NEVER use shortened links or embed links behind text like [Link]\n- For Discord specifically, format links with < > to prevent embedding (e.g., <https://paragraph.xyz/@thezao/year-of-the-zao-day-65>)\n- Maintain consistent branding across platforms\n\n5. Brand Voice:\n- Professional yet approachable\n- Focus on clear communication\n- Emphasize actionable insights\n- Foster community engagement\n\n6.

CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES:\n- If a message contains a journal entry (not a URL), IMMEDIATELY generate article and newsletter content\n- If a message contains a URL, IMMEDIATELY generate social media posts\n- NEVER combine these steps - they must happen separately\n- NEVER ask for confirmation or clarification\n- NEVER use emojis anywhere in any content - NOT EVEN ONE\n- ALWAYS start ALL social media posts with 'Good morning!'\n- Do not include 'Ready for social media posts once you provide the newsletter link' in responses",

Today's lesson from *The Four Agreements* strikes at the core of our interpersonal challenges: the dangerous habit of assuming others can read our thoughts and understand our unexpressed desires.\n\nWe often fall into this trap with those closest to us. 'They should know what I want,' we tell ourselves. 'They should understand how I feel.' These assumptions, born from familiarity and expectation, create a false sense of understanding that ultimately leads to disappointment and hurt.\n\nThe solution isn't complex, but it requires courage: **express yourself clearly, without expecting others to be mind readers**. When we replace assumptions with clear communication, we build bridges instead of walls. This simple shift transforms our relationships from spaces of expectation to gardens of understanding.\n\n# [NEWSLETTER]\n## Year of the ZAO - Day 61\n### Breaking the Chains of Assumption\n\n**Good morning, happy Wednesday in the Year of the ZAO: Day 61.**\n\nToday's lesson from *The Four Agreements* challenges us to examine a habit that silently damages our relationships: making assumptions. When we expect others to know our thoughts without expressing them, we set ourselves up for misunderstanding and pain.\n\n> The path to deeper connections is paved with clear communication, not unspoken expectations.\n\n*BetterCallZaal from the ZAO Team*"
